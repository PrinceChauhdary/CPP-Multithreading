# CPP-Multithreading
C++ Multithreading Examples – A collection of programs demonstrating multithreading concepts in modern C++ (C++11 and beyond), including threads, mutexes, synchronization, and concurrency patterns.

# 🚀 C++ Multithreading Examples

This repository contains examples and implementations of **multithreading in C++**.  
It is designed for learners and developers who want to understand how to write concurrent and parallel programs using **modern C++ (C++11 and above)**.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Creating and managing threads with `<thread>`
- Passing arguments to threads
- Detached vs joined threads
- Synchronization using `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard`
- Avoiding race conditions
- Using `std::condition_variable`
- Thread utilities (`sleep_for`, `get_id`, etc.)
- Introduction to thread pools (advanced)
